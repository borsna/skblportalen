        Why are there no women artists, philosophers, scientists, politicians, 
        and authors? This question surfaces, every time the history of art, 
        literature, medicine, and philosophy is to be written. One important 
        reason is that the writing of history is based on existing biographical 
        dictionaries, where the principle of selection is gender-biased. In the 
        large Swedish biographical dictionaries, women account for only 
        5-10 percent of those biographied. 
        Therefore, if the writing of history is to become less misleading, 
        the very point of departure – the source material – has to be revised.

        The aim of the present project is to create an on-line Biographical 
        Dictionary of Swedish Women (SWO) to be linked to other internet 
        archives and on-line works of reference dealing with Swedish women. 
        This on-line Dictionary will itself instigate and contribute to further 
        research and scholarly work. The SWO will be published in both a 
        Swedish and an English version. 
        It will be available on the internet as a continually developing 
        and freely accessible database. In this way, information about Swedish 
        women’s contributions to society, from the Middle Ages to the present, 
        will be easily available to both Swedish and international scholars.

        The project is funded by the Swedish Foundation for the Humanities and 
        Social Sciences for 2016-2017. After the conclusion of the project, the 
        database will be managed by SWE-CLARIN.
